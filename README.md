# Count-Everything
This project provides a simple secured quantitative query through multiple institutions. Project website: http://counteverything.ucsd-dbmi.org/. 

## Overview

Count Everything enables users to pose a secure and anonymous count query across three BD2K centers (MD2K, PIC-SURE, and CBDTG) based on homomorphic encryption (HME); it then divides the query into domain-specific parts and sends them to the corresponding center. Each center provides partial query results corresponding to their domain; the system then uses secure computation models to return the results back to the users without compromising privacy.
